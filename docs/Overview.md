This project is a **personal portfolio and CV website**, designed to act as both a **professional platform** and a **learning environment**.

The goal is to showcase:
- Who I am
- What I do
- My experience
- My personal and technical interests
- My long-term aspirations
- Selected projects (e.g., GitHub integrations)
- A simple contact form

The website will be built using modern frontend technologies (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion), and aims to help me improve in areas such as:
- Frontend architecture and component design
- UI/UX best practices
- Color theory and branding
- Page transitions and animations
- Documentation and process discipline

It is also meant to train my **workflow**: planning, iteration, documentation, and deployment.
## Future Expansion Possibilities
- A blog section where I can share learnings and progress
- Fun/interactive elements like a small embedded game (e.g., a mini browser game, like the dino game found in google chrome when there's no internet)
- A dark/light mode toggle
- Language selector (for both Danish and English)
- Reusable components or themes for future side projects
