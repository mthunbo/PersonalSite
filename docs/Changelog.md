# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-27

### Changed
- **Pivoted Architecture:** Shifted from a planned Multi-Page App (MPA) to a Single-Page Application (SPA) to improve user flow and leverage existing scroll-based components.
- **Rebranded Color Palette:** The primary brand color has been officially changed from Green to a dark, imperial Red (`#800020`) to better align with the "Roman/Ancient" theme. The Green is now designated as the secondary `accent` color.
- **Refactored Codebase:** Updated `tailwind.config.js` and all component files to reflect the new semantic color naming (`primary`, `accent`).
### Added
- **Project Management:** Implemented a formal `CHANGELOG.md` and restructured the Kanban board to include a `Backlog` for better task management.
